Interests 

• I love playing all types of sports, but mainly Golf and baseball.

• I find computer security extremely interesting and thats why my major is dedicated towards it.

• I like playing video games, mainly first person shooters, but also story games are quite interesting and complex to figure out which I enjoy.

Technical Background 

My programming experience I would say is intermediate, I know Java, C, and Python. Python is my favorite language to use as it is very syntax friendly. C is my 
second favorite as there are some strange memory rules throughout the language. Java is just confusing to me with all the syntax.
